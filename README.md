## HW 1 - MapReduce algorithm
Perform a *market basket analysis* exploiting the *MapReduce algorithm* explained in class.  All the details are reported
[here](https://github.com/stefanobinotto/Big-Data-Computing-course/blob/main/Homework%201/PresentationHW1.pdf). 

Homework 1: [folder](https://github.com/stefanobinotto/Big-Data-Computing-course/tree/main/Homework%201)

## HW 2 - kcenterOUT algorithm
Solve the *weighted variant of the k-center problem with outliers* by implementing the *kcenterOUT algorithm* described during the lecture and reported
[here](https://github.com/stefanobinotto/Big-Data-Computing-course/blob/main/Homework%202/PresentationHW2.pdf). 

Homework 2: [folder](https://github.com/stefanobinotto/Big-Data-Computing-course/tree/main/Homework%202)

## HW 2 - kcenterOUT algorithm
Solve the *k-center problem with z outliers* by implementing the *2-round coreset-based MapReduce algorithm* described during the lecture. All the details are reported
[here](https://github.com/stefanobinotto/Big-Data-Computing-course/blob/main/Homework%203/PresentationHW3.pdf).
